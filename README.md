# Robotic Navigation and Exploration Assignments

This repository contains all the assignments I have completed for the **Robotic Navigation and Exploration** course. Below is a brief overview of each assignment. You can find more details in the corresponding PDF files and the code in each directory.

## 1. Path Planning
- **Objective**: Implemented path planning algorithms including A*, RRT, and RRT* to compute feasible paths in a 2D environment. 
- **Assignment Details**: [PDF: Path Planning Assignment Requirements](https://github.com/hsylin/Robotic-Navigation-and-Exploration/blob/main/HW1/HW1.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `HW1` directory.

## 2. Path Tracking
- **Objective**: Developed and evaluated path tracking control strategies for robotic navigation, implementing algorithms (PID, Pure Pursuit, Stanley, LQR) across diverse kinematic models (basic, differential drive, bicycle) and designing collision handling mechanisms.
- **Assignment Details**: [PDF: Path Tracking Assignment Requirements](https://github.com/hsylin/Robotic-Navigation-and-Exploration/blob/main/HW2/HW2.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `HW2` directory.

Note: The course is still ongoing, and the repository will continue to be updated.
